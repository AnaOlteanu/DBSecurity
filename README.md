# Database Security project in Oracle SQL
Master's project designed to showcase the configuration, implementation and management of database security concepts on a chosen data model. It consists of 6 modules: Introduction, Data Encryption, Auditing activities on the database, Users and resources management, Privileges and roles, Database apps and data security. 
The [documentation file](https://github.com/AnaOlteanu/DBSecurity/blob/main/DBSecurity_documentation.pdf) contains a summary of all the stages of the project, while the [sql_scripts folder](https://github.com/AnaOlteanu/DBSecurity/tree/main/sql_scripts) 
contains all the scripts needed for developing and solving the project's requirements.
The model chosen for this project is meant to be integrated in an intern managament system of a bank. The purpose of this model is to store and manage information about a bank's branches, about customers who have opened accounts at one of the existing branches, 
and about the issued cards associated with the accounts. This model allows the bank to efficiently and securely manage customer information and provide quality financial services. 
This management system can be used by both bank employees and customers who want to find out information about the accounts or cards they own.
